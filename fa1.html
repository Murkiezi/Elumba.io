	      <h2>Morning Routine</h2>
	      <p>What do you think the start of your workday look like? What do you wear, where do you go, and what’s the environment like? You can add pictures here. Make sure to cite your sources.</p>
	      <p>As a Disney Imagineer, my day usually starts early in the creative studio or at one of the Disney parks. I review sketches, design notes, and updates from engineers or artists. I often wear casual yet professional attire since we move between brainstorming rooms and testing spaces.</p>

	      <h2>Midday Tasks & Projects</h2>
	      <p>Describe your main job duties or activities. Who do you work with? What tools or skills do you use?</p>
	      <p>During the day, I collaborate with a variety of specialists, engineers, architects, artists, sound designers, and animators. Our main goal is to create attractions that are cool. I might help sketch a new theme park ride, test an animatronic mechanism, or adjust lighting and sound for a show scene.</p>

	      <h2>A Story from My Dream Job</h2>
	      <p>Add an inspiring short story or describe a special moment from others who are already working your dream job — like solving a problem, helping someone, or doing something exciting in your job.</p>
	      <p>One inspiring story comes from Lanny Smoot, a veteran Disney Imagineer who invented dozens of effects used in Disney parks. I'd love to be in a job wher they do all these fun and cool things!!.</p>
