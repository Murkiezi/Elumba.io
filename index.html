        <h2>Background of the Problem</h2>
        <p>
            It is a question that is increasingly posed by a society that has become terrified of its young. 
            When is a juvenile no longer a juvenile? To a growing number of lawyers, politicians, and citizens, 
            the answer is that youthful offenders who commit “grownup” crimes should no longer be treated as children. 
        </p>
        <p>
            A tragic example is the case of Sophia Marie Coquilla, who was found dead in her home in Tagum City. 
            Suspects, all minors, were involved. Because of the current law, they were only arrested but not reprimanded 
            as harshly as adults would be. This highlights the urgency of reviewing the juvenile justice law in the Philippines.

        <h2>What is Being Done?</h2>
        <p>
            In late July, Senator Robin Padilla filed a bill allowing 10-17-year-olds to face criminal charges. 
            This aims to hold minors accountable for serious crimes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Philippine Supreme Court has also released guidelines for determining "discernment" in crimes involving minors.
        </p>

        <h2>Where We Come In</h2>
        <p>
            Our advocacy seeks to spread awareness about the consequences of juvenile crime, 
            and to push for responsible reforms that balance justice with rehabilitation for youth offenders.
